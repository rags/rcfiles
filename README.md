config
======
This repo has all my dotfiles and scripts to setup a machine with all software that I need.

.zshrc depends on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
Usage
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rags/config
cd config
./setup
```
